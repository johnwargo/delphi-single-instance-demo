# Delphi Single Instance Demo

A sample Delphi application that illustrates how to implement a single instance of an application (where only one instance of the app runs at any time) along with passing runtime parameters to the single instance if another instance is launched (with runtime parameters, obviously).

I was trying to figure this out on my own when I discovered [How to run a single instance of an application](https://delphidabbler.com/articles/article-13) on the [Delphi Dabbler](https://delphidabbler.com/) site.
